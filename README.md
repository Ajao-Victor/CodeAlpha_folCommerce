    Getting Started
Ready to try Folcommerce out locally? Hereâ€™s how to set it up:
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)
PostgreSQL (set up locally or via a cloud provider like RenderDB or Heroku)
Git
A browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

    Installation

Clone the Repo:
git clone https://github.com/Ajao-Victor/folcommerce.git
cd folcommerce


    Set Up the Backend:

Navigate to the backend folder (if separate, e.g., backend/):cd backend
npm install


Create a .env file in the backend folder with:DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key


Start the backend:npm start

Note: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and has products and cart_items tables (see schema below).


Set Up the Frontend:

Navigate to the frontend folder (e.g., root or frontend/):cd ../frontend


Install http-server globally (if not already installed):npm install -g http-server


Serve the frontend:http-server


Open http://localhost:8080/index.html in your browser.


Database Schema:Create the required tables in PostgreSQL:
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    image_url TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE cart_items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
    quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);


    Test It Out:

Register/login to get a JWT token (stored in localStorage).
Browse products, add to cart, view cart, and checkout.
Use the search bar to filter products.
